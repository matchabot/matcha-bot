# Overview

Getting started with MatchaBot.

## What is MatchaBot

MatchaBot is a code generator. Creating boilerplate code is a waste of time ‚è∞.

üèó MatchaBot will **increase your productivity** by generating files, components and directories in a systematic way.

## Why I created it ?

`create-react-app` includes a code generator to create the first version of your application, but it will not offer the possibility to add new files to a project.

Coding includes a lot of repeative tasks.

Fo example, when I generate a **react component** I also need to create a corresponding **unit test**, and **storybook**. I want also to enforce a certain component directory structure in the project directory and apply some navigation conventions.

I started to develop **code snippets** with a produtivity tool such as [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/), it was great to create small chunks of code, but I felt frustated very quickly üòñ.

- A code snippets expander doesn't offer a way **to generate multiple files or a directory structure**
- The snippets lives outside my project and it's **difficult to share** with my team

Then I started to search tools to create generators, I found 3 candidates:

- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)
- [Polp](https://plopjs.com/)
- [Hygen](https://www.hygen.io/)
